This design is the most suitable for this system. This is because it tends to eliminate redundant data, in the sense that all recurring attributes have been put together in the Zoo super class. From here, all the other classes can inherit these attributes from the Zoo super class. It also eliminates the unneccessary repeatition of program code which tends to make programming very lengthy and boring.
This design has only two levels of inheritance, which makes programming easier and program execution faster. The classes are well structured and from the super class to the child classes, modifications can easily be made.
